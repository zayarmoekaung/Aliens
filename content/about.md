Hello there 
We Are Aliens!
Earth is now a small world.
The human race is connected better and faster than ever before but what about elsewhere? Could we one day be part of a galactic community sharing our knowledge and ideas? Or is Earth the only planet with life? »We Are Aliens!« takes you on an epic ride in the hunt for the evidence of alien life. This production balances science, education and family entertainment. »We Are Aliens!« narrated by Rupert Grint is an exciting new 360° Fulldome digital planetarium show produced by NSC Creative with input from UK astronomers.
